Provides playlists of recommendations based on your top tracks in Spotfify (because there isn't enough inbuilt recommendations playlists).<br>
The design is fairly simple, I agree.

Works on localhost:5173 for now, planning to host a domain.
<h3>Current features</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Generate Recommendations</b> - creates/refreshes the "Recommendations playlist" playlist, which contains recommendations based on user's top tracks</li>
    <li><b>Generate "shuffled"</b> - creates/refreshes the "Daily Shuffle" playlist, which contains recommendations based on user's top tracks <b>shuffled</b></li>
    <li><b>Current Log</b> - logs everything the app has done so far</li>
</ul>

<h3>The ultimate goal</h3>
The ultimate goal of this project is to actually refresh the playlists once a day automatically at 12AM. This will require dividing the server from the client and an actual running server (ideally with a working site).
Don't know when I'll come around to doing this as I'm quite busy in uni right now.
