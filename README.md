# daily-recommendations
Provides a daily playlist of recommendations based on your top tracks (not 6 themed like Spotify has)

Still in development, works on localhost for now, planning to host a domain (likely will be using GitHub's hosting)

Current state - working "Generate recommendations" button. Creates the "Recommendations playlist" if there isn't one, and refreshes it if it exists.

If you for some reason stumbled on this repository and have any ideas on what to add/what to improve, please message me <a href="waraidako.god@gmail.com">waraidako.god@gmail.com</a>

TODO
- Add refreshing at 12AM
- (not sure if want to do) Scrambled recommendation - randomize the top tracks array before seeding it to recommendations
- <strike>Add a check if the "Recommendations playlist" is already present and refresh if it is</strike>
- <strike>Custom amount of recommended tracks</strike>
