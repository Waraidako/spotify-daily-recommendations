# daily-recommendations
Provides a daily playlist of recommendations based on your top tracks (not 6 themed like Spotify has)

Still in development, works on localhost for now, planning to host a domain

Current state - working "Generate recommendations" button. It makes a new playlist, currently it does not check if the playlist is already present

TODO
- Add refreshing at 12AM
- Add a check if the "Recommendations playlist" is already present and refresh if it is
- Custom amount of recommended tracks
